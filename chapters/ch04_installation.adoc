== Installation

OpenStack offers an orchestration component called
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat[Heat]. This is a template
system. The user provides a set of customizing parameters and then
submits those and the template to the Heat service which then creates
a _stack_, the named deployment of the new application.
